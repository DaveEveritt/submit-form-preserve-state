# Form submission preserving state on page reload

A very simple example.

Uses a one-property [LocalStorage](https://javascript.info/localstorage "Guide to LocalStorage on JavaScript.info") item to preserve, send and restore a binary choice from a simple button press ("start/stop").

A very basic [Secure Web Socket](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/websocket-security "Article on Web Socket security") (wss) opens a communication that allows posts to and communication from a script on the same domain. On a server, wss works over port 443.

See a [working example on GitHub pages](https://daveeveritt.github.io/submit-form-preserve-state/).
